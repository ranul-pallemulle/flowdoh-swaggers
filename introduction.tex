\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
Flowdoh has been improving steadily in its ability to connect to external applications. Examples of such integrations include Microsoft's Outlook API, and Google's Cloud translations API. In order to make full use of these capabilities, an administrative user or systems integration engineer must be able to write a Swagger file for use with Flowdoh. In this document we will explore the basics of structuring Swagger files and then move on to Flowdoh-specific considerations where we will look at defining Actions and Triggers.

\subsection{Background}
A Swagger file is a text file that defines an API. It can be written in JSON format or YAML format. It contains such information as the API host (the URL to interact with), the authentication method to use, the different operations that are available, and much more. What makes this file a "Swagger" file is the structure of the data within it. The structure is defined by the OpenAPI specification (formerly the Swagger specification). In essence, the goal of the specification is to provide a document format that is sufficiently generic such that it can define the majority of APIs that are available. The format should be expressive enough to be human-readable, and it should be precise enough for a computer to parse and gather all the information needed to interact with the API. As a result of improvements on both fronts, several versions of the OpenAPI specification have emerged. There are two major versions - 2.0 and 3.0. Version 3.0 has several minor versions, such as 3.0.1 and 3.0.2.

OpenAPI 3.0 overcomes many of the limitations of version 2.0. Any API that can be defined using OpenAPI 2.0 can also be defined using OpenAPI 3.0, perhaps even with greater precision. Moreover, certain features in Flowdoh such as Triggers from external applications can only be defined using OpenAPI 3.0. As such, we will limit the discussion in this document to OpenAPI 3.0.
