\section{Actions}
\subsection{Basic Definition}
A Flowdoh Action can be defined as an \texttt{operation} within a given \texttt{path} in the Swagger file. There can be multiple operations defined under the same path; they will correspond to distinct Flowdoh Actions.

\subsection{The \texttt{operationId} and \texttt{x-zen-action} Properties}
The \texttt{operationId} field is used to uniquely identify an operation within the Swagger file. Even though \texttt{operationId} is defined as an optional field in the OpenAPI specification, Flowdoh requires this field to be present (especially in the absence of the \texttt{x-zen-action} property). If the \texttt{x-zen-action} field is not present, the value of the operationId field will be displayed in the Action selection list when inserting a new Action into a workflow. \texttt{operationId} is typically supplied as a name without any spaces - e.g. GetUserById. Therefore, in terms of user experience it may be confusing to see a list such as FIGURE. The name displayed in the Action selection list may be overridden by specifying the \texttt{x-zen-action} property. Note that even if the \texttt{x-zen-action} property is specified, it is recommended that the \texttt{operationId} property is still supplied as it may be used for other purposes such as linked operations (see trigger section).
